                        THIS IS JUST A PLACE HOLDER We discovered that most first time home buyers are freshly graduated college students who don't have much capital, want a cheap house and preferably want a house that does not have a downpayment. Usually these houses are the ones that are foreclosed. 
                        The website that we are creating is going to give first time home buyers a place to look for areas in form of a heatmap that have foreclosed houses and will be able to make decisions or analyze the area based on the foreclosures.
