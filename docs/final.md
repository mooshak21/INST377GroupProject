### Information Problem 
There is a lack of websites that give first time homebuyers a place where they can look and find foreclosed homes that are cheap. This websystem would allow first time homebuyers to find low-priced homes that were foreclosed.
This would also help our target population against their competitors, who may have more favorable financing and with investors who pay cash.

### Target Browsers and Stakeholders
By creating this website, we wanted to target these stakeholders: 
* Investors who are looking to buy cheap properties to invest on and improve to utlize the property to sell it at a higher price
* Homeowners who are looking to buy homes to invest in and to sell at a potential higher price
* First time homebuyers like college students who are looking for cheap housing. 

## Data
For our heatmap we chose to use PG County Foreclosed homes dataset 

### Strategies and Solutions to solve the problem
Initally we wanted to create a heatmap that showed the concentration of the homes that were in PG County. Ideally, this website would give our stakeholders a list of homes that are on low priced. 

### Technical System 
We decided to do what we did because we wanted to do something a little more than just a map with markers and a little more fancy.

## Final System
Unfortunatley we believe that our system does not fully meet the needs of our stakeholders. We think that our dataset is limited in its information that is providing and it is unable to say if the foreclosed homes are actually low priced. We can only see the location of these properties and the property id. Because of this issue we are not able to help our first time home buyers

## Challenges Faced
For our project we faced a lot of challenges during development. Some of these challenges were 

* We did not have a dataset that had coordinates intially, but with the help of Group 9 Morning Team, we were able to get a dataset that had coordinates
* To create a heatmap, we needed to have a value or a count that measured the density/intensity of a geolocation which slowed our process down. 
* We had issues deploying our project into Heroku due to the structure and nodes installed of our project. 
* The dataset that we were working with was very limited and our scope of the project was bigger than what the dataset could provide. 


## Future Work Directions with this problem 
* If we were to continue this problem, we would have found another dataset that had more informaiton for the foreclosed homes in the area. In that case, we would ideally create a heatmap showing the locations of these foreclosed homes. The heatmap would allow filtering abilities where the customers would be able to look by zipcode, property id and give back information based on the filters in a table form.
* What we also have done differently is that maybe instead of a heatmap we could have done markers, and if we were to click on a marker it would have taken us to show a view of the house and then maybe return a table with all the information.
